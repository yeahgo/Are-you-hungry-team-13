    "Note: The following cell serving to offer the top recommendations works well for vast majority of cases. However, there are a few extreme cases. Only numerical values can be compared when we used the sort() function to sort the filtered restaurants and provide the top rated restaurants(at most 5) as recommendations. In fact, tiny amount datas in the column of \"restaurant_rating\" are not numerical because of some possible perturbations during web scrapping, which is very normal. Thus, sort() function can't execute on the \"restaurant_rating\" column when non-numerical values coexist with numerical values. As a result, recommendations can't be offered when we confront this rare issue. Under this circumstance, you can still refer to the returned raw panda dataframe before, which is absolutely reliable."
